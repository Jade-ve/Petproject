    <h1>ME AND MY HUMAN!!</h1>
    <h4>The World Has To Know</h4>
<div class="right"></div>
    <p>My human is one lazy being. She spends her whole day riding in cars and<br>
         then comes back home and sleeps. My days are quite busy. My first <br>
         task after she leaves is to go through the trash for better food.<br>
          I know it contains good food because I've seen her keep some of <br>
          her food there after finishing dinner. I remember this one time<br>
           I had to be taken to the hospital after eating food from the trash<br>
            because too much of a good thing is always bad for you.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
        After trash-hunting, I have a good fighting session with my arch nemesis,<br>
         the red yarn ball. So far, I have won every single fight. When I'm worn <br>
         out and tired I take a good long hour to clean my magnificent fur.<br>
